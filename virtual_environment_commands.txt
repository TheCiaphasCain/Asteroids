====== VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT 101 ======

By crreating a virtual environment that encompasses a coding project, you ensure that the environment

is reproducible and isolated. this means that each project has its own seperate dependencies and 

libraries and their versions. this prevents conflicts that can arise when different projects use

different versions of the same thing.

this makes project management easier, simplifies packaging, and makes it easy to manage dependencies.
